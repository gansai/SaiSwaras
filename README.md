##SaiSwaras

This project was an attempt undertaken during 2nd half of the year 2011.
The aim of the project was to build a website which would contain swaras (music scripts in carnatic classical notation) for Sri Sathya Sai
Bhajans. It would help bhajan enthusiasts to learn about the swaras behind the bhajans and would help instrumentalists to try playing bhajans
on their instruments.

I started collecting pictures of various deities, various bhajans, and swaras. 
I even created a website using weebly. It is still hosted at: http://saiswaras.weebly.com/paramam-pavithram.html
But, since I could not get the swaras or 
create them on my own, I could not contribute consistently.

Later, one of my friends told me that similar thing is already being done. I checked it out and it looked good and served the purpose.
If you are interested, you can check it: http://media.radiosai.org/journals/vol_14/01JAN16/bhajan-tutor-Gajavadana-Gananatha-Natha.htm

And I have discontinued this project.
